## Ideas
- Online note taking app with editor and storage
- Real time sync and collaboration feature.
- RAG will be implemented to answer smart queries and AI can be used to generate notes too.

## How will i implement this:

- First i need to figure out text editor part. 
- The text should be rendered in markdown or simple format. IDK let's figure this out
- and edited text then should be synced with the file too.
