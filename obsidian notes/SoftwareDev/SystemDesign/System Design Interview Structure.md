## Step 1: Requirements clarification

* Asking clarifying questions are very important. 
* Clear all doubts about requirements. Have a clear picture of requirements.
* Then asking what part of the whole system should you go in depth after drawing a high level picture.

## Step 2: Defining the system Interface

* Asking relevant question regarding the communication with/between systems.
* Defining right APIs, right protocol and overall thing.

## Step 3: Back of the envelope estimation

* Now you should ask relevant question to get the scale in mind. Based on that you can define scale approx. and then design the components accordingly.
* Based on the scaling requirements of the system we can decide the data storage model.


## Step 4: Defining data model

* So then you can define data storage model, partitioning, transportation, encryption and backup.
* Based on requirement lay out the database type to be used.
* Messaging and caching.


## Step 5: High-level design

* Now try to lay out a very high level design for the system, layout high level functionality that solves the end to end system.


## Step 6: Detailed Design

* Dig Deeper into two or three components. And take feedback from your interviewer that which subsystem you should dive deep.
* Defining tradeoffs is crucial. 


## Step 7: Identify bottlenecks and optimizations

* The system won't be perfect. We need to identify the bottlenecks and points of failures.
* If some performance optimization can be done using CDN, caching and deployment strategy.
