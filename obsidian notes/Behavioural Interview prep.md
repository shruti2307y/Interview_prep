### **LP1: Customer Obsession**

Sample Questions:

- Tell me about a time you solved a pain point for customers.
- Tell me about a time when you dealt with a demanding customer
- Tell me about a time you used customer feedback to drive innovation
- Tell me about one of your projects where you put the customer first.

My-Answer

S: In my project with my first team where we were developing a org restructuring tool. Our stakeholders/customers wanted to include some KPI at each level or the structure. These KPI were very specific to how bank’s wanted to optimize their org tree.

T: So I was developing the backend, so I had to come up with the calculations flow. I had to make sure this computations does not effect the overall performance of the application and make it as seamless as possible. 

A: So I started from the bottom up. I made some changes to the data structures, made the computation happen only on the part of org that the user is viewing currently. And then also made those KPI customisable too. So user can change those KPIs at will.

R: Well that led to the stakeholder extremely happy that not just they have those specific KPIs displayed but they can change those to their will and that seemed to be a very useful feature for their use case.


### **LP2: Ownership**

Leaders are owners. They don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results.

They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say, “that’s not my job.”

Sample Questions:

- Tell me about a time you had to make a decision to make short-term sacrifices for long-term gains
- Tell me about a time you made a bold and difficult decision
- Describe a challenging situation in which you had to step into a leadership role.
- Tell me about a time when your project failed.

My-answer:

S: So in my second team’s project. We wanted to add a panel to display Book’s ETA  and state of different calculations scenario. For that we had two options. Make a api call from frontend itself and display it there or go through the proper data pipeline where we would be making changes to multiple middleware applications.

T: Here the task was to come up with an approach to solve this. And I thought of not taking a shortcut here and do it properly with building the full data flow. Because it would make the work extensible too and we would learn the application system from end to end. And will also help other teams to also do similar kinda integration with the system.

A: For that I started to learn the framework but it was challenging coz there were no proper doc and also it was an in-house developed framework. But nevertheless I made changes to multiple micro services. It was unprecedented so it took me some time but eventually I did it properly. With both changes in backend as well as in the frontend.

R: As the result we had our Book prediction system developed end to end. And it was done with building proper data pipelines, handling fault tolerance and minimising resources utilisation. And due to this we also helped overall tribe with paving out a way to do similar kinda thing with their use case. 


### **LP3: Invent & Simplify**

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods.

Sample-questions:

Tell me about a time you improved a complex process.
Tell me about how you brought a product to market.
Tell me about a time when you solved a complex problem.a

My-answer:

S: So the framework VAS was built very tightly coupled with Oracle database in mind. And we wanted to extend VAS datasource to postgresql data source too,

T: As this was unprecedented we had to understand the code for the app as well as the framework.  

A: I went through the code and docs tried figuring out how to solve this. Finally in an iterative manner I was able to do this after doing changes in the app’s code and extending to the frameworks capability to change it to our own use case.

R: This resulted in first time ever VAS was getting connected to a different data sources and this could help future teams to develop new data flow with the database of their choice.

  

### **LP4: Invent & Simplify**

Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

Sample-questions:

- Tell me about a time you made a decision based on your instincts.
- Tell me about a time you had to make a decision without much customer data.
- Tell me about a time when you had to convince team members on something you proposed.
- Give me an example of a calculated risk you took where speed was critical.
- Tell me about a time you had a problem and had to discover the real cause.

My-answer:

S: We were given a task to develop an AI system that can generate adjustments on a book with proper attribute and value.

T: Asses the Data and find out the approach to do this. Build an AI model.

A: Well I dwelled into the data find out different patterns for different books at first they seemed a characteristics of a particular book but it wasn’t. I then tried to understand how adjustments actually arise in this books. I attended some shadow sessions, spoke to different people and finally understood the nature of this problem and why this can not be solved with AI. Not only it is critical but it wouldn’t help to improve the overall efficiency of the book runners as they will have to verify those results. 

R: Hence we took an informed decision on why this problem shouldn’t be solved using AI but rather some automation can be done and consolidation of data sources was one of the potential solution.


### **LP5: Learn and Be Curious**

Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

Sample-questions:

- Tell me about a skill you recently learned. 
- Tell me about a time you built out a process.
- Tell me about a time you exceeded expectations.
- What’s your product ideation process?
- Tell me about a time when you solved a problem innovatively.

My-answer

S: In my first team we were given a project on building an org restructuring and visualisation tool. As bank was simultaneously were looking out for venders too,

T: We had to gather product knowledge, gather all the requirements, talk to the HR counterpart on how they would likely to use a product like this. 

A: To fulfill this I had attended the vender demo call, talked to different people on how org tree are structured also how the HCM system work, what is the overall framework of HCM and all.

R: through this I gained a deep knowledge on how org structures behave, how restructuring happens, what are the requirements of the users and how can I solve them efficiently. Hence I designed my application in accordance to that only.

  
#### **LP6: Have Backbone; Disagree & Commit**

Leaders must respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly

Sample questions

- Tell me about a time you faced technical and people challenges simultaneously.
- Tell me about a time when you had a disagreement with your manager.
- How do you manage difficult conversations?
- Tell me about a time when you had an idea you proposed that was not agreed on.
- Tell me about a time you disagreed with someone and how you resolved it.

My answer

S: We were near our release date and my manager had come up with a feature that we should let user upload their own excel files that would have an org structure. So that they can change and view that and can save it.

T: Well I opposed this as developing this could take considerable amount of time as well testing it. Also our system was using multiple files to make a dual view org structure. And having such feature can limit the overall functionality of our tool. 

A: I had a constructive discussion with him and proposed that this feature will be pushing forward our release date and can potentially also have a negative impact of our tool functionality with this feature. 

R: later on our team and manager both agreed to park this feature for now and focus on release and other features that will be more beneficial to the user than this.




#### Q: Tell me about a time you worked on a team and faced a challenge.

Answer:

S: So for my first project within workforce analytics and reporting team, We were tasked to make a org restructuring tool. Business was actually looking out for vendors to fullfil this reqr.

T: tool that will let user view org tree with a whole lot of performance indicators, run simulations on it and run reports and save and edit. We were first tasked to gather as much requirements as possible, so we attended vendors demo, understood the product reqr as well as specific needs from the business, simultaneously building the tool.

A: we built the tool within a period within this journey we showcased this tool to the Global HR head and multiple higher management as well.

R: Finally the business users agreed to go ahead with our tool, and we rolled it into production with liver users such as HR consultant.


#### Q: Describe a time when you had a disagreement with a coworker. How did you handle it

Answer:

S: So with my second project within Accounting department. We were in the release window, and we had merged our changes to the release branch. But for some reason the ci pipeline was failing due to some unknown timeout error for integration test. and coworker from the sister team were on to us to handle this or revert our changes back.

T: Now in this situation we were unaware of the part that why this pipeline was failing. We went ahead and asked the senior engineers that they had faced the same issue, turns out there was some problem with the pipeline itself.

A: So i talked to the lead of sister team, and tried to empathise and connect with them explaining the situation and also pulled in my VP into the conversation. I apologised for the delay in the release tag generation and tried to solve it as soon as possible. Turns out after several retries it succeeded.

R: Finally i was able to resolve the conflict and also the lead from the sister team also helped us with the releasing it to the prod and our teams bonding did better up for the good.


#### Q. Give an example of a time when you took the lead on a project.

S: So within my first project i was leading the architecture and design of the application.

T: My task was to design the application system, and also develop the whole backend. and decide how front end flow would work.

A: I first started with designing an high level architecuture, data sourcing and security. Then i started working on the low level design, entities and algorithms to be used.

R: So I successfully delivered an application with proper design, which is modular and in the future if needed more functionality could be introduced with min efforts. and made sure the application is efficient with the memory requirement and less latency.


#### Q. Tell me about a time when you had to manage multiple priorities. How did you prioritize?

S: So for my first project again, i was near a deadline for implementation of role based security along side making certain UI changes at the time.

T: So the system needed to consume an external api which would based on userId and roles provided, will tell whether the user has access to the level or organization or not. and based on that certain UI components will get rendered.

A: I first prioritize the api integration, thought about how to reduce down the latency of calling the api on each level, and used a caching mechanism there. I also simultaneously changed UI to fallback component whenever user doesn't have access to view that KPIs.

R: I was able to successfully deliver that with proper testing in time, and stakeholders where quite satisfied with the fallback UI and responsiveness of the UI.


### Q. Describe a time when you failed to meet a goal. What did you learn?

S: So i was doing an POC on using splunk logs for Malicious user activity tracking system.

T: So i needed to study whether such logs exist within splunk, i started off with exploring splunk queries and finding out some logs were there. So i neede to identify what activity we can track.

A: I began and jumped into conclusion that i can do it and i can scale this for all the activity that user is making. Turns out those were very limited logs that were being generated by the back system and background processes. After talking to multiple teams i found out that logs were not written in a consistent manner to be able to tracked like this.

R: So i finally talked with my manager and told him my findings, i told him that I didn't check for the whole set of logs and tried to make decision on a subset of data. 


### Q. Tell me about a difficult decision you made.

S: So with my second project, we wanted to integrate our predictive pipeline with the existing DB tool.

T: So Integration with existing system which was the central application for banks PnL reporting. 

A: So i started talking with multiple teams and architect for this integration, tried to understand the existing application data pipelines and UI. I was given two options, either call our apis directly through the UI and handle entitlements and permissions separately. Or go through banks existing flow with integrating our database with the data pipelines so that in future more things can be accomplished with the same pipeline.

R: I talked with my manager and laid out both these options and told me the tradeoffs and potential future enhancement with second approach. We then decided that yes second options seems difficult but would benefit the whole team for future integration to the existing system.
